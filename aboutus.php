								<h3>LATE Shri Rajkripal Ji<span class="subtitle">Founder </span></h3>
								<p style="color:#000">While Shri Shambhu Nath ji sowed the seeds of what was to become SRG in 1895, it is Shri Rajkripal Ji who founded the Sumitra Rajkripal Group. From a small store to a thriving international presence as an indisputable leader in solid and engineered timber, the Sumitra Rajkripal Group owes its steady rise to Shree Rajkripal Ji’s exceptional vision and unflinching hard work. 

At the very helm of the company, Shree Rajkripal Ji has been a force to reckon with not only in the timber industry but also in the field of education. A well known philanthropist, he devoted his life to the education of girls at a time when the idea was virtually non-existent. He founded the C.B.S.E. school, Smt. Brahmadevi Saraswati Balika Vidya Mandir, in 1988, with only 10 students. Today, the school has nearly 1800 students, 65 teachers, 25 projects and 1,250 awards, imparting education through conventional as well as smart classes. 

His guiding principles of ethics, quality and commitment continue to guide the group.</p>
